## 2. How We Use Your Data

## 3. How AI Processes Your Content

Your notes are processed server-side by AI to automatically organize and categorize them. Specifically:

- Text notes and transcribed voice memos are sent to our servers for analysis.
- We use third-party AI services (currently **OpenAI** and/or **Anthropic**) to help with categorization and semantic understanding.
- These AI providers process your content under their data processing agreements with us. Per our agreements, they **do not use your content to train their models**.
- AI processing is used solely to provide you with the organization features of The Dump.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

| Service | Purpose | Data Shared |
|---|---|---|
| **Firebase (Google)** | Authentication, infrastructure | Email address, account identifiers |
| **OpenAI** | AI content processing | Note content (text) |
| **Anthropic** | AI content processing | Note content (text) |
| **Apple** | In-App Purchase billing | Subscription/transaction data (managed by Apple) |
| **Stripe** | Web subscription billing | Email, payment info (managed by Stripe) |

Each provider operates under its own privacy policy and our data processing agreements.

## 5. Data Storage & Retention

- Your notes, audio files, photos, and documents are stored on our servers for as long as your account is active.
- We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data in transit and at rest.
- When you delete a note, it is removed from our active systems. Backup copies may persist for up to 30 days before being permanently purged.
- When you delete your account, all associated data is permanently deleted within 30 days.

## 6. Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Sell your personal data
- Share your data with advertisers
- Use your content for any purpose other than providing the service

We **may** disclose data if required by law, regulation, or valid legal process.

## 9. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 10. International Data Transfers

Your data may be processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers operate. When data is transferred outside your jurisdiction, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place consistent with applicable law.

## 11. Changes to This Policy
