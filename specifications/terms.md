## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use The Dump. If you're under 18, you represent that a parent or guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.

## 2. What The Dump Does

The Dump is a note-taking app that lets you capture voice memos, photos, files, and text notes. Our AI automatically organizes and categorizes your content. All AI processing happens on our servers — your notes are sent to our backend for analysis and organization.

## 5. Your Content

You own everything you put into The Dump. We don't claim ownership of your notes, voice memos, photos, or files.

By using the App, you grant us a limited license to store, process, and transmit your content solely to provide the service (including AI-powered organization). We don't use your content for advertising, and we don't sell it.

## 6. Acceptable Use

Don't use The Dump to:

- Store or transmit illegal content
- Violate anyone else's rights
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, exploit, or compromise the App or its infrastructure
- Abuse the service (e.g., automated bulk uploads intended to circumvent usage limits)

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.

## 7. AI-Powered Features

The Dump uses AI to categorize and organize your notes. This processing is automated and happens server-side. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated organization is provided as-is and may not always be perfect. You should not rely on the App's categorization for critical decision-making without independent verification.

## 8. Availability & Changes

We aim to keep The Dump available and reliable, but we don't guarantee uninterrupted service. We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time. We'll make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes.

## 9. Account Deletion

You can delete your account and all associated data at any time through the App's settings. Deletion is permanent — we cannot recover your content after deletion. See our [Privacy Policy](https://thedumpapp.com/privacy) for details on data deletion.

## 10. Disclaimers

The App is provided "as is" and "as available." To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, George Labs is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App. Our total liability for any claim related to the service is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 13. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We'll notify you of material changes via email or in-app notice. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.
